# butterfly effect in open-gl

i was asked to deliver some work on chaos theory and my group choose lorenz attractor as object of study. it’s a really nice chaos function as you can learn in the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lorenz_attractor) page dedicated to the subject.the work was developed in opengl but i’m pretty sure that it would have been easier to do so in povray

if you want to give the application the project is hosted at [github](https://github.com/dscape/isdgl)

you’ll need gcc, build-essentials and – who would of thought? – the opengl libraries. it’s all explained in a slightly demented [readme](https://github.com/dscape/isdgl/blob/master/readme) file

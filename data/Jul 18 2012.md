# how to update a document with nano

couchdb is [mvcc] so updates are not done in place. when you insert a document into couchdb a pointer will say "for this uri this is the current version of the document".

so in a sense there's no updating in a mvcc database, updates mean changing a pointer.

in `nano` i deliberately tried not to have parts of the api called "update", or "connect" since those things are not things that you do in couchdb. in couchdb, you insert:

``` javascript
// insert {foo: "baz"} into the "foobaz" document
db.insert({"foo": "baz"}, "foobaz", function (error, foo) {   
  if(!err) {
    console.log("it worked");
  } else {
    console.log("sad panda");
  }
});
```

if you need to `update` a document then you should just insert again (but specifying the revision you are updating):

``` javascript
db.insert({"foo": "bar"}, "foobar", function (error, foo) {
  if(err) {
    return console.log("I failed");
  }
  db.insert({foo: "bar", "_rev": foo.rev}, "foobar", 
  function (error, response) {
    if(!error) {
      console.log("it worked");
    } else {
      console.log("sad panda");
    }
  });
});
```

you need to specify the revision so that couchdb can make sure for you that no one did conflicting updates while you where editing the document. if the `rev` you send to couchdb is not the latest `rev` you will get a conflict.

you can also use design documents to perform updates in couchdb. read more on how you can do that with nano at [jackrussell](http://jackhq.tumblr.com/post/16035106690/nano-v1-2-x-document-update-handler-support-v1-2-x).

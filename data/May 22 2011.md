# jsbbq.org and some portuguese poetry

attended [jsbbq](http://jsbbq.org) yesterday. it was fun, [mikeal](http://mikealrogers.com) does a great job at organizing stuff.

just finished translating another portuguese poem, this time by fernando pessoa:

     to be great, be whole; 
     exclude nothing, exaggerate nothing that is not you. 
     be whole in everything. put all you are 
     into the smallest thing you do. 
     so, in each lake, the moon shines because it blooms up above.

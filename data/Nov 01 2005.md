# a sudoku game in haskell

small game and gui for playing sudoku called [su-doku-9x9](https://github.com/dscape/su-doku-9x9). funny thing, i think sudoku is boring. plus did brute force cause a 9x9 grid is no challenge, ever. there's some cool strategies out there if you have enough time to investigate though
